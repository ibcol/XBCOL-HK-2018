                  <p>This course extensively explores the concept, need, importance, and future of digital identity, a
                    fundamental aspect of digital transactions which ensures integrity in connecting the physical and
                    the digital world. Deep dive into how a legal entity may prove its own identity and check those of
                    other parties, via unique, verifiable, and authentic digital identity. Discuss and compare the
                    various approaches to create digital identity. Scrutinize the challenges of creating, deploying, and
                    servicing digital identity. Investigate the impact of personal data privacy regulations such as the
                    EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for blockchain. Take a glimpse of some advanced
                    cryptography — zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic
                    encryption, and proxy re-encryption — and explain how they are used in conjunction with blockchain
                    to address privacy issues arising from digital identity.</p>
